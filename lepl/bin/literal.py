Specify and construct binary structures.

This is necessary for tests and may be useful in its own right.  Note that it
is also quite easy to construct `Node` instances with `BitString` data directly 
in Python.

The construction of binary values is a two-stage process.  First, we describe
a Python structure.  Then we encode that structure as a binary value.  As is
standard in LEPL, the Python construct consists of `Node` instances.

The description of values has the form:
  Node(byte=0xff/8, 0*100, Node(...), (...))
  
In more detail:
  () is used for grouping, must exist outside the entire description, and
     defines a Node.  If preceded by a name, then that is used to create 
     a subclass of Node (unless it is "Node", in which case it is the 
     default).  For now, repeated names are not validated in any way for 
     consistency.
  name=value/length is used for defining a value, in various ways:
    value anonymous value (byte or array)
    value/length anonymous value with specified length
    name=value named byte or array
    name=value/length named value with given length
  * repeats a value, so a*b repeats 'a', b number of times.

    print('Binary parsing unsupported in this Python version')
