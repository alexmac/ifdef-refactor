Graph traversal - supports generic Python classes, but has extensions for 
classes that record their own constructor arguments (and so allow deep 
cloning of graphs). 

The fundamental `dfs_edges` routine will traverse over (ie provides an iterator 
that returns (flag, node) pairs, where flag describes the type of node and 
ordering) a graph made of iterable Python objects.  Only the __iter__ method
(implemented by all containers) is required.  However, in general this is too
broad (for example, Strings are iterable, and single character strings contain 
themselves), so a type can be specified which identifies those nodes to
be treated as "interior" nodes.   Children of interior nodes are returned as
"leaf" nodes, but are not iterated over themselves.

The `order` function provides a simpler interface to this traversal, allowing
a particular order to be generated, and, for example, optionally excluding leaf
nodes.

`ConstructorGraphNode` is motivated by data constructors and exposes its 
constructor arguments (this is important because if we are cloning a graph 
we want to replace constructor arguments that correspond to child nodes with 
their clones).  This currently has a single implementation, 
`ArgAsAttributeMixin` (there used to be another, but it was equivalent to
the generic case with `SimpleWalker`).

The 'Walker' (`SimpleWalker` and `ConstructorWalker`) and `Visitor` classes
provide a different approach to traversing the graph (compared to the simple
sequences of nodes provided by `dfs_edges` et al), that reflects the emphasis
on constructors described above: the walker takes a visitor sub-class and 
calls it in a way that replicates the original calls to the node constructors.

    Generate an ASCII graph of the nodes.
    
    This should be used with `ConstructorWalker` and works rather like
    cloning, except that instead of generating a new set of nodes we
    generate a nested set of functions.  This set of functions has the
    same structure as the tree of nodes (we break cycles via loop).
    The leaf functions take prefixes and return an ASCII picture of
    what the leaf values should look like (including the prefixes).
    Functions higher up the tree are similar, except instead of returning
    a picture directly they extend the prefix and then call the functions
    that are their children.
    
    Once we have an entire tree of functions, we can call the root with
    an empty prefix and the functions will "cascade" down, building the
    prefixes necessary and passing them to the root functions that
    generate the final ASCII data.
