    means it takes a single list or generator as an argument, so to use
    literally you might type List([1,2,3]) - note the "extra" list.

    We need some kind of fold-like procedure for generalising operations on
    arbitrarily nested iterables.  We can't use a normal fold because Python
    doesn't have the equivalent of cons, etc; this tries to be more Pythonic
    (see comments later).
    
    We divide everything into iterables ("lists") and atomic values ("items").
    per_list is called with a generator over the (transformed) top-most list, 
    in order.  Items (ie atomic values) in that list, when requested from the 
    generator, will be processed by per_item; iterables will be processed by a 
    separate call to per_list (ie recursively).
    
    So this is more like a recursive map than a fold, but with Python's 
    mutable state and lack of typing it appears to be equally powerful.
    Note that per_list is passed the previous type, which can be used for
    dispatching operations.
